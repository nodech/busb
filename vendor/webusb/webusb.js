 *
 * You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

 * negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 * liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 * incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.

                    The below code tries to infer the last known ABI compatible version
                    that we have recorded in the abi_crosswalk.json when an exact match
                    is not possible. The reasons for this to exist are complicated:

                       - We support passing --target to be able to allow developers to package binaries for versions of node
                         that are not the same one as they are running. This might also be used in combination with the
                         --target_arch or --target_platform flags to also package binaries for alternative platforms
                       - When --target is passed we can't therefore determine the ABI (process.versions.modules) from the node
                         version that is running in memory
                       - So, therefore node-pre-gyp keeps an "ABI crosswalk" (lib/util/abi_crosswalk.json) to be able to look
                         this info up for all versions
                       - But we cannot easily predict what the future ABI will be for released versions
                       - And node-pre-gyp needs to be a `bundledDependency` in apps that depend on it in order to work correctly
                         by being fully available at install time.
                       - So, the speed of node releases and the bundled nature of node-pre-gyp mean that a new node-pre-gyp release
                         need to happen for every node.js/io.js/node-webkit/nw.js/atom-shell/etc release that might come online if
                         you want the `--target` flag to keep working for the latest version
                       - Which is impractical ^^
                       - Hence the below code guesses about future ABI to make the need to update node-pre-gyp less demanding.

                    In practice then you can have a dependency of your app like `node-sqlite3` that bundles a `node-pre-gyp` that
                    only knows about node v0.10.33 in the `abi_crosswalk.json` but target node v0.10.34 (which is assumed to be
                    ABI compatible with v0.10.33).
